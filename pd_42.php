			<td class="heading">Uses: </td>
			<td>Some clinical research shows that taking
ashwagandha can reduce some symptoms of
anxiety or anxious mood. Taking a specific ashwagandha
extract for 8 weeks might
improve brain function in people being treated for
bipolar disorder. Preliminary research shows that
ashwagandha in combination with an alternative
form of medicine known as Ayurvedic therapy
might improve balance in people with cerebellar
ataxia.</td>
